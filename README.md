Currently shows your stats of messages/snaps

Shows stats as a print statement, But im currently doing the stats side then will look into displaying data nicely

-Would be interesting to in the future implement:
  - Comparing the graphs of blocked friends with friends added
  - Most friends added in each month
  - Memories history has lang and long -> use to make a map of all your 'hotspots'
